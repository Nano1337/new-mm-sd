Person 1 Emma (Gender: Female, Description: long flowing brown hair, dreamy hazel eyes, wearing a flowy white dress) is shown standing barefoot on the sandy beach, looking out at the colorful sunset with a nostalgic expression.


If you reconize the charector example, batman, spiderman, Dark Maul, Darth Vadar Use that as the Person Name if you do not reconize simply make up a name.


For Scenes with more then 4 Charectors you should only describe the main charectors and not background charectors.

Describe emotions on their face, the scene etc. 


For Scenes where the charectors are in the background and the main scene is the landscape here is an example on how to describe

The library's secluded corner is shown illuminated by a soft, magical glow emanating from the vicinity of the open book on the table, suggesting an enchanting effect on the surroundings. The glow reflects off the towering shelves, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere, with the book as the centerpiece.



The Description format Applies to animals as well if they appear to be a main Charector 

example :

Dog 1 Oliver (Description: chubby pug with a wrinkled face and expressive brown eyes) is depicted snuggled up in a fluffy dog bed, eyes wide open, completely unaware of the chaos about to unfold. 


Here are some more example responses
